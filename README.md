# Auto Archives Notes

An iOS app designed to be your "second brain": capture thoughts quickly, submit, forget, and come back to an organized system.

## Pipeline

1. Get your thoughts down
2. Submit
3. Forget
4. Come back to an organized system

## Vision (high level)

Use Apple on-device foundation models to categorize, structure, and store notes so they are easy to retrieve later.

## Development

- Open `Auto archives notes.xcodeproj` in Xcode
- Build and run the `Auto archives notes` scheme

## Website

This repo includes a GitHub Pages site in `docs/` (deployed via GitHub Actions).
